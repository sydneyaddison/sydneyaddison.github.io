    <h2> Project Explanation </h2>
   <p> My project was a simple quiz for incoming 9th grade students. I am teaching with a summer program called Breakthrough Collaborative this summer, so I wanted to create a tool that I could use in my classroom. There are five questions in this quiz, so there is an opportunity for students to gain 500 points if they are truly a biology *star*. </p>
   <p> There are several functionalities of my program, which will be explained in the Quiz Walkthrough section.

    <h2> Challenges Overcome </h2>
    <div class = "list"> <ul type="circle"><li> Exhaustion </li>
     <li> Coming up with a useful and fun idea </li>
     <li> Figuring out how to get a new game to be created after clicking "Play Again"
  <li>   Getting the timer to start over again with each new question</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2> Goals Achieved </h2>
    <div class = "list"> <ul type="circle"><li> Able to design an app that actually ran </li>
      <li> Stayed at Hack110 all night (without sleeping!) </li>
      <li> Made something without getting frustrated and starting over because the program wasn't perfect</li>
      <li> Made a simple HTML web page </li>
      <li> Learned a little bit about the material I'm supposed to be teaching this summer (RIP because even I didn't get 500 points on the quiz) </li>
